                    Assam has the largest economy in the North-east region of our country. But the scenario of job market in Assam is not impressive. Unemployment is a significant problem in Assam. The report from the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Limited (NEDFL) published in October 2017 stated that over 1.75 lakhs jobs will be required by the state annually till 2020. Assam, at present, is facing the twin challenges of increasing unemployment and a mushrooming young population. Both factors have a significant impact on the employment market.
                    The outcome of study reflects that there is an extreme demand for employment in Assam.

                    India is the second highest populated country in the world with the total population more than 138 crores (as of June 8, 2020) and Assam is one of the 28 states in India having a massive population of 3.5 crores. About 87% of Assam’s population lives in the rural areas. According to a survey conducted by the Telegraph, the All-India rural unemployment rate is 10.3 %, whereas in Assam it is 5.9 %. This means that more than 2 lakhs people are still unemployed in our state. Due to this unemployment issue, people are forced to accept low and insufficient wages, economic development became difficult, political instability is created, poverty has increased, social evils like dishonesty, gambling, immorality, etc. has also increased. This is why unemployment is a very prominent problem in our society today. Therefore, it is important to create as many job opportunities as possible to minimize the unemployment rate in the rural areas of our state.

                     As education is the key to success and the key to decrease unemployment. It opens door to many possibilities and help the person with both life and work skill. The lack of educations makes ones life to poverty. So the Assam government help the students by launching <strong>Anundoram Borooah Award Scheme</strong> in the year 2005 to promote competition spirit among students and to provide up to date information of IT Technology. Students securing first devision star mark in HSLC(10th/Metric), High Madrassa and FM examination conducted by SEBA and State Madrassa Education Board, Assam can avail ARBAS scheme benefits. The state government has also launched the <strong>Abhinandan Education Loan Subsidy Scheme</strong> 2020 for students. Under this scheme, govt. will encourage students to pursue higher studies by providing subsidy on education loans. CM Sarbananda Sonowal distributed 1 time education loan subsidy sanction letters of Rs. 50,000 each to 1,546 students. During this pandemic also, the Assam government launched a new <strong>Pragyan Bharti Scheme</strong> 2020 for students. According to this scheme all students those who are studying in govt. schools, UG/PG courses as well as living in hostels will be beneficial. There are many more scheme which the goverment of Assam launched to help students. In this way, more people will be able to go to school and learn important skills which will help the present generation in the future for getting jobs.

                     <strong>Skilled Based Training, Vocational Training, Technical training:</strong> Skills are developed through skilled-based training, vocational training, and technical training. This greatly benefit those who are unable to afford university education or did not obtain sufficient grades to get into one. It would help tackle the problem of unemployment among the youth in rural areas who tend to end their pursuit of education after completing high school. Equipping them with such skills make them employable in a labour market that is very dependent on technical skills and training. Such training would also put them in a position where they qualify for better pay. Employers tend to pay skilled workers better than unskilled labourers. For which Assam Skill Development Mission was set up under the protection of Skill Employment and Entrepreneurship Department. The vision of the mission is capacity building of the unemployed youth and to deliver quality skill training leading to more employment. Some of the private companies are also providing such skill-based training.

                  IV. Proposed solution

                  <p class="card-text">
                    To minimize the problem of unemployment, we have decided to form an organization where we will train the jobless youth of the rural areas of our state, provide them some initial jobs within our organization (form a work-brigade), and later guide them until they find some work with good wages. We have noticed that today’s youth lack in planning their future careers so we will also provide career counselling/guidance to all the people in our work-brigade. Further we will be organizing periodic boot-camps to enlighten the villagers about family planning as we also consider it one of the root cause that leads to unemployment.
                    We will also have a website which will give real-time analysis of current unemployment status and it will also be able to predict the future outcome of our work (i.e., future unemployment rates and our success in developing the skills of our people). This will be done by applying implementing various Data Analysis and Machine Learning algorithms in our website. We will make it accessible to all the government agencies, private companies (operating in Assam), as well as to the common residents of the rural areas of Assam. We hope that through this website of ours, we will able to-
      
                    <ul>
                      <li>earn the trust of the government</li>
                      <li>captivate the interest of the private companies in our employees</li>
                      <li>attract major population of the unemployed youth toward our scheme </li>

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Our solution is efficient in nature because we are focussing on wholesome development of the youth. We have a 3 stage employment scheme. In the first stage, we will train the people to develop various important skills that are in demand in he job market. After they acquire those skills, we will employ them in our organization to give them an exposure to work experience in industries, which is the second stage of our plan. In the third stage, we will arrange and link them with the companies through our website who are willing to hire them after they are employable. In this way we will be able accommodate a large population of unemployed youth within our organization and get them employed elsewhere later when they are ready. To make sure that more and more people join us and to motivate them, we will pay a decent amount to the people in the training (first) stage and considerably greater amount when we employ them in our organization (second stage).

                    We do not think that there is any negative impact on the environment by our solution since our plan is based on a service and not on product. We will be needing continuous electricity supply for the training purpose since we will be using a good number of computer in our company, we will also need water and food supply.

                    Despite of the fact that our government has introduced many schemes to tackle the problem of unemployment still the problem of unemployment remains unresolved in the remote rural areas of Assam. This is because it becomes difficult for the government to reach out to each and every villages in Assam and moreover there are still many illiterate people in Assam. Also the government has very limited amount of jobs to accommodate all the population of the rural areas. 
                    And our solution is to create a separate organisation/body that looks after the matters of educating and developing the skills of these people. Later when they are ready we will employ them within our own company with a decent amount of pay, to enhance their experience of working in the private firms. Then we will help them to get employed by some other companies. As we mentioned earlier, we have three stages in our proposed plan which is completely unique and novel to our company.

                    We are highly optimistic that our solution will help reduce the rate of unemployment in rural Assam. We hope that we are able to attract a lot of people to participate in our plan.

They can work in our company for as long as we are not able to offload them to some other companies. We are confident that many companies (both government and private), will be interested to hire people from our work-brigade as the people by the time they leave our company, will have both skills and work-experience that most of the companies desire in their employees today.

                    The roadmap we made is based on the current scenario of the unemployment status, job market and the facilities available in the villages. We have presumed that we have no expiry date for our proposed solution. But there are some things that we would like to change as the time passes and the future availability of the facilities especially, electricity and decent network for good internet speed. Our amendments in our plan will be as follows-
                    <ul>
                      <li>We will include more domains under training</li>
                      <li>Once the network facilities in the rural areas are good and all the households are able to afford the internet services, then we would be hosting the family planning boot-camps, career counselling sessions and other workshops online. This will save the time at both ends.</li>
                      <li>After about five years we would no longer campaign to make people aware of us. We would put all our details on our website and rely on Google Ads and Facebook Ads to advertise our work.</li>
                      <li>We would be using Artificial Intelligence to update our website and databases in future.</li>
                      <li>When we are well known to the companies of our state, then we would cease to host the worker’s exhibition. The companies’ representatives will be able to contact us through our website through our integrated chat feature. They can either test our temporary employees online or offline based on their requirement and time.</li>

                          Unemployment of youth has always been a prominent problem faced by mostly the rural part of Assam. Due to which majority of people from these areas are migrating to the cities and also to different states in search of a better lifestyle, leaving only a handful of population who are indulged in the agricultural activities. Unemployment is mainly caused because the villagers lack the knowledge about their state and how to raise a family in a way that is benificial both for government and themselves and the youth lack the integral skills that are required in order for them to get employed and one more concern is that villagers are not much aware of the private jobs that are available, so they only rely on getting a government job. The seats available in the government posts are limited so it becomes impossible for them to accommodate all the youth from both rural and urban areas. By creating an organisation that focuses on enlightening the villagers with the knowledge of family planning, career guidance, developing important skills of the unemployed youth, creating a temporary employment stage for the sake of experience and later introducing these skilled people to the numerous amount of companies that are operating in our state, we believe that we will have success in solving the problem of Unemployed Youth in Rural Assam.

                          If our organization succeeds in executing all our plans then in future we will hopefully try to encourage the private companies (both product and service based) who are looking for quality employees, to establish their branches in our rural areas. It will not be very hard for us to convince the companies because by that time we will already deliver a majority of the skilled youth to the private companies. When these private companies shift their branches to the rural areas, this will further aid to solve the problem of ‘Unemployment’ in our rural areas. Later we have also planned to support the start-up plans of the people who are getting trained in our organization.
                          Unemployment is problem faced by almost all the states of our company. So, establishing our branches in other states of India also forms a part of our future plans.
